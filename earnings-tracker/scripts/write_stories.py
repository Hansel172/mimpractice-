"""Adds a short plain-English "story" to each company already written to
docs/earnings/data.json by build_public.py.

This is deliberately a separate step, run after the mechanical build, not
folded into it — same split as the macro tracker's refresh.py (numbers) vs
themes.json (judgment). analyzer.py computes every fact; this script only
narrates facts that already exist. It is never given room to invent a red
flag, a number, or a trend that isn't already in the data — the prompt
hands it the exact same good/bad/ugly/red-flag/streak lines the app itself
renders, and tells it explicitly not to introduce anything beyond them.

Uses httpx directly against the Messages API rather than the anthropic SDK
— this codebase has stayed on httpx alone throughout, and one JSON POST
doesn't justify a second HTTP dependency.

Requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in .env (local) or as a GitHub secret (Action).
Skips silently — the rest of the app still ships — if it's absent, since a
missing story is a lesser failure than a broken build.
