"""Pulls company financials and the earnings calendar from free, keyless
government and exchange sources.

Why not a paid API: the original design called for Financial Modeling Prep,
but testing showed its free/legacy endpoints were retired, and even the
current plan caps history at 5 quarters. Everything here comes straight from
SEC EDGAR (the primary filings themselves) and Nasdaq's public calendar,
with no subscription and no cap on history.

The one real cost of using raw SEC data instead of a packaged API: companies
don't all use the same XBRL tag for the same concept, and each filing can
report the same quarter more than once (a quarter's own number, plus a
year-to-date cumulative number, both tagged under the same concept). Both
problems are handled below rather than assumed away.

# Concept fallback lists. Companies tag the same line item differently, so
# each concept lists every common tag in priority order — the first one a
# company actually reports wins. GrossProfit is deliberately absent from the
# fallback chain: when a company doesn't report it directly, it's derived
# from Revenue minus CostOfRevenue instead of guessing at a substitute tag.
# Each concept maps to (fallback tag list, XBRL unit key, can_derive_q4).
# Nearly everything is a dollar FLOW figure, so quarters sum into the annual
# total and a missing Q4 can be derived as FullYear - Q1 - Q2 - Q3.
#
# EPS cannot use that trick. It's a per-share RATIO (net income / diluted
# share count), and share counts differ quarter to quarter — ratios from
# different periods don't subtract into a meaningful result the way dollar
# totals do. Deriving Q4 EPS this way produced -$0.25 for a real NVIDIA
# quarter that was solidly profitable, caught by checking output against
# what was actually known to be true rather than trusting the arithmetic.
# EPS is marked non-derivable; a missing Q4 EPS is preferable to a wrong one.

    filled in where it's missing (dollar figures only — see the comment on
    CONCEPTS for why EPS is excluded).

    Four problems get fixed here:
      1. Duration filter (80-100 days) — SEC filings report both a quarter's
         own figure AND a year-to-date cumulative figure under the SAME tag.
         A 90-day span is a true quarter; 180 or 270 days is 2- or 3-quarter
         cumulative. Keeping only ~90-day spans throws out the cumulative
         duplicates.
      2. Same period filed twice — a restatement or amendment can report an
         identical end date again later. The latest `filed` date wins.
      3. Companies switch tags over time — e.g. Microsoft reported under
         "Revenues" only through 2010, then "RevenueFromContractWith-
         CustomerExcludingAssessedTax" from 2016 onward (the 2010-2016
         transition period isn't in either tag's SEC data at all). Taking
         only the first fallback tag with any data would silently return
         a decade-stale slice and never reach the current one — caught by
         testing MSFT specifically, where "Revenues" had data but all of it
         predated 2011. Every tag is fetched and merged so whichever one a
         company is CURRENTLY using is what actually shows up.
      4. Q4 is usually never filed as its own ~90-day figure at all — only
         the 10-K's full-year total exists in XBRL. For additive dollar
         figures it's derived as FullYear - Q1 - Q2 - Q3 whenever exactly
         three quarters inside that fiscal year are already known.
